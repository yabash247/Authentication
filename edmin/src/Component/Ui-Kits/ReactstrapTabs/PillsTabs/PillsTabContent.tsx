          The ultimate goal of every web design is to create a site that will reach its audience and be useful to them. In order to achieve that, it is necessary to befriend Google's mechanisms and algorithms. There is no use of a pretty website, if it's displayed on a 10th page of search results, because this way no one will ever find it. That brings us to the topic of Google's Website Ranking.Generally speaking, it's a list of pages and their keywords, sorted in the order of search results. The higher your place in the ranking is, the more people are likely to see your page.
